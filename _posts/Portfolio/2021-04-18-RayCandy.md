Currently in the very early stages of development, RayCandy is my personal framework for developing new and experimental Vulkan Pipelines, and also produced with the hopes of educating others in graphics programming. RayCandy achieves this by taking away fine grained control of the GPU away from the user, instead allowing them to specify the number of attachments, and buffers, and then giving the file path to the shaders.
