Written for my MMath dissertation before I became a full time coder, I plan to revisit this project with my enhanced knowledge of graphics programming. The project uses hyperbolic reflection groups to reflect the bounding regions of mirrors across the hyperbolic plane. Software raytracing is used to associated each pixel on the Poincar√© with a point on the hyperbolic plane, this could be improved apon using Vulkan's raytracing intersection shaders.
