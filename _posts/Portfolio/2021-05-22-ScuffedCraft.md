ScuffedCraft is an attempt to port the famous voxel game "Minecraft" to the Nintendo Wii. The "scuffed" part is an affectionate reference to my poor art ability and the limitations applied by the hardware platform. Scuffedcraft is written in C using the DevkitPPC libraries, which are a series of open source libraries and tools that make up a development kit for the Wii.

I took on this project because I wanted to expand my abilities to construct a full game engine from scratch, using the Nintendo Wii instead of a modern platform would force me to write my code as efficiently as possible. GRRLIB is the graphics library provided by the devkit, and is unfortunatley limited to an OpenGL 1.0 style implementation. As a result, this entry in my portfolio is not trying to create stunning visuals, but rather show off my ability to construct and manage a large on going project, and to build an efficient game engine.

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
